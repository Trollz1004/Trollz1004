- Avg Premium: 120 users
- Avg Premium Plus: 30 users
- Monthly Revenue: $120×$9.99 + 30×$19.99 = $1,797

Months 4-6: Growth (500 → 2,000 users)
- Avg Premium: 600 users
- Avg Premium Plus: 200 users
- Monthly Revenue: $600×$9.99 + 200×$19.99 = $10,790

Months 7-9: Acceleration (2,000 → 5,000 users)
- Avg Premium: 2,000 users
- Avg Premium Plus: 600 users
- Monthly Revenue: $2,000×$9.99 + 600×$19.99 = $31,194

Months 10-12: Scale (5,000 → 12,000 users)
- Avg Premium: 5,000 users
- Avg Premium Plus: 1,500 users
- Monthly Revenue: $5,000×$9.99 + 1,500×$19.99 = $79,485
