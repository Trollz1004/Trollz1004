Your Netlify project exists, but needs the built files uploaded.

### 🎯 FASTEST METHOD - Drag & Drop:

1. **Open Netlify Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://app.netlify.com/sites/incomparable-gecko-b51107
   ```

2. **Look for "Deploys" tab** at the top

3. **Find the drag & drop area** that says:
   ```
   "Need to update your site? Drag and drop your site output folder here"
   ```

4. **Open the dist folder** on your computer:
   - **In VS Code (any OS):** Right-click `date-app-dashboard/frontend/dist` → "Reveal in File Explorer" (or "Reveal in Finder" on Mac)
   - **Windows File Explorer:** Navigate to: `Trollz1004\date-app-dashboard\frontend\dist`
   - **Mac/Linux Finder or Files:** Open your file manager and go to `date-app-dashboard/frontend/dist`
   - **Terminal (Mac):** Run `open date-app-dashboard/frontend/dist`
   - **Terminal (Linux):** Run `xdg-open date-app-dashboard/frontend/dist`
   - **Look for the folder with `index.html` and `assets/` inside**
   - **In VS Code:** Right-click `date-app-dashboard\frontend\dist` → "Reveal in File Explorer"
   - **Windows:** Navigate to: `Trollz1004\date-app-dashboard\frontend\dist`
   - **Full path:** Look for the folder with `index.html` and `assets/` inside

5. **Drag the ENTIRE `dist` folder** into the Netlify drop zone

6. **Wait 10-30 seconds** → Green checkmark → LIVE! ✅

## 🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Netlify CLI

If drag & drop doesn't work, use CLI:

```bash
# In VS Code terminal or Command Prompt:
cd date-app-dashboard\frontend

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Link to your site
netlify link

# When prompted:
# → Choose: "Use existing site"
# → Select: "incomparable-gecko-b51107"

# Deploy!
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

---

## ✅ AFTER UPLOAD - VERIFY IT WORKS:

### 1. Visit Your Live Site
```
https://incomparable-gecko-b51107.netlify.app
```

**Expected:** Dating app homepage with "You & I Not AI" branding

### 2. Check Console (F12)
Open browser DevTools → Console tab

**Expected:** No major errors, API calls to Railway backend
