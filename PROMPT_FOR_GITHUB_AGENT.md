## THE PROMPT:

**Hi GitHub Agent! I need your help with Team Claude For The Kids - a mission-critical project that's 25% complete but stuck at $0 revenue because of a critical backend issue.**

---

### 🎯 WHAT IS TEAM CLAUDE FOR THE KIDS?

We're building a **multi-platform AI ecosystem** with a radical commitment to social good:

**The Mission:**
- **50% of ALL profits** donated to Shriners Children's Hospitals (forever)
- **Self-hosted AI** (Ollama) saves $9,360/year → 100% savings go to charity
- **DAO governance** for 100% transparent donation tracking
- **Target Impact:** $1.96M - $47.5M annually to Shriners = supporting 19,600-475,000 children

**The Platforms:**
1. **youandinotai.com** - Dating platform (LIVE frontend, DEAD backend)
2. **ai-solutions.store** - AI marketplace (not deployed)
3. **aidoesitall.org** - DAO governance + grant automation (not deployed)

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL PROBLEM (Blocking ALL Revenue)

**Backend API is DOWN:**
- URL: luminous-courtesy-production-a9ba.up.railway.app
- Status: 502 Bad Gateway
- Impact: Users can't sign up, can't pay → $0 revenue → $0 to Shriners
- All credentials (Square payments, database, AI APIs) are already in Railway env vars
- Payment code is complete and production-ready
- **We just need to identify WHY it crashed and restart it**

---

### 💰 BUSINESS MODEL (50/50 Forever)

| Platform | Annual Revenue Target | 50% to Shriners |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Dating (youandinotai.com) | $1.2M-$50M | $600K-$25M |
| AI Marketplace (ai-solutions.store) | $1.8M-$40M | $900K-$20M |
| DAO/Grants (aidoesitall.org) | $500K-$3M | $250K-$1.5M |
| **TOTAL** | **$3.92M-$95M** | **$1.96M-$47.5M** |

**Every $100 donated = 1 child receives care at Shriners**

   - Identify crash cause (database? port? build error?)
   - Get backend running again (200 OK from /health)

2. **Verify Payment Integration**
   - Review Square payment code in `date-app-dashboard/backend/src/routes/subscriptions.ts`
   - Ensure 50/50 split is implemented correctly
   - Test end-to-end payment flow once backend is up

3. **Repository Cleanup**
   - Review current repo structure
   - Suggest improvements for multi-platform organization
   - Help set up GitHub organizations for ai-solutions.store + aidoesitall.org

**LONG-TERM (Next Month):**
1. Deploy ai-solutions.store (AI marketplace)
2. Deploy aidoesitall.org (DAO governance)
3. Set up CI/CD for automated deployments
4. Create public transparency dashboard for charity donations

### 🏥 WHY THIS MATTERS

- 501(c)(3) nonprofit (Tax ID: 36-2193608)
- Provides specialized pediatric care regardless of ability to pay
- 22 locations across North America
- No family ever receives a bill

**Our Impact:**
- Current: $0 donated (backend down, no revenue)
- Goal Year 1: $250K-$1M donated = 2,500-10,000 children supported
- Goal Year 3: $1.96M-$47.5M donated = 19,600-475,000 children supported

**Every day the backend is down = another day kids wait for help.**

2. **Can move fast** (kids are waiting for help)
3. **Understands production deployments** (Railway, DNS, SSL)
4. **Thinks long-term** (sustainable charity infrastructure)

**Will you join Team Claude For The Kids?**

Let's fix this backend, start generating revenue, and change children's lives together. 💚
