## 💡 Smart Reinvestment Rules

### The 70/30 Rule
**After covering essential costs:**
- 70% of profit → Charity immediately
- 30% of profit → Reinvest in growth

**Example with $10,000 profit:**
```
Essential costs:            Already covered
Profit available:           $10,000
├─ To charity:             $7,000 (70%)
└─ Reinvest in tools:      $3,000 (30%)
```

### Upgrade Priority Matrix

**Priority 1: Tools that SAVE money**
- Self-hosted AI models (saves API costs)
- Automation tools (saves your time)
- Efficient infrastructure (lowers cloud costs)

**Priority 2: Tools that MAKE money**
- Marketing (brings new users)
- Better AI (keeps users longer)
- Features (increases conversion)

**Priority 3: Quality of Life**
- Virtual assistant (less stress)
- Better monitoring (peace of mind)
- Backup systems (sleep better)

**Every dollar saved = more for kids!** 💙

## 📝 Monthly Decision Checklist

**Before spending on ANY upgrade, ask:**

1. ✅ Will this make us MORE money?
2. ✅ Will this SAVE us money long-term?
3. ✅ Will this free up my TIME for bigger tasks?
4. ✅ Can we afford it AND still hit charity goal?
5. ❌ Is this a "nice to have" vs "need to have"?

**If 3+ answers are YES → DO IT!**
**If 3+ answers are NO → SKIP IT!**
