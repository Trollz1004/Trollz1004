NEW YORK, NY - November 9, 2025 - You & I, Not AI, a dating platform designed for verified humans only, today announced its NYC beta launch with an unprecedented charitable mission: 50% of all subscription revenue automatically donated to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

"When 1,000 users subscribe, that's $10,000 per month going directly to help kids," Coleman explained. "Dating with purpose isn't just a tagline—it's built into our payment system."

**NYC Beta Program**

The platform launches today in New York City with a limited beta program accepting the first 100 verified singles. Subscription tiers range from $9.99 to $29.99 per month, with corresponding charity contributions of $5 to $15 per user.

## 💬 FAQ RESPONSES (Copy/Paste)

**Q: How do you verify real people?**
```
Great question! We use multi-factor verification:
1. Government ID verification
2. Live photo verification
3. Behavioral analysis
4. Community reporting

AI bots can't pass all these checks. Real people can.
```

**Q: How do I know the charity money actually goes to Shriners?**
```
Full transparency! We use Square payment splits that automatically send 50% to Shriners' account. You can request a transparency report anytime at charity@ai-solutions.store.

We also publish quarterly charity reports showing total donations.
```

**Q: Why NYC only?**
```
We're starting local to perfect the experience! NYC beta lets us:
- Build a strong local community
- Host in-person meetups
- Get direct feedback
- Ensure quality before scaling

More cities coming Q1 2026!
```

**Q: What if there's no one in my area?**
```
